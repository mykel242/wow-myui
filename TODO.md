- [x] Test and validate unified timestamp system

**Benefits Achieved:**
- üéØ Consistent positioning of death markers, cooldowns, and timeline events
- üíæ Reduced memory usage by eliminating duplicate timestamp storage
- üîß Simplified logic with single timestamp calculation method
- ‚ö° Better performance with no redundant time conversions
- üêõ Easier debugging with TimestampManager as single authority
